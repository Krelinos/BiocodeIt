# BiocodeIt
A mod for Rimworld that allows you to biocode your own weapons.
## Overview
Your enemies biocode their weapons to prevent you from stealing and using them, so why can't you? Well with this mod, now you can!

Simply grab your nearest advanced component, craft it into a biocoding tool, and use it on your favorite weapon to **biocode it!** Whoever uses the tool will be the owner of the weapon forever...

...Which is actually quite a downside. Make sure you really want this before you apply it.

## Mod settings:
* Biocoded Value Multiplier - In vanilla, biocoded things have no value. By default, this mod has it at 35% value, but you can make it 0% to 100%, and if it is high enough...

* Biocoded Thief Chance - Your enemies will steal your high valued biocoded things just because they hate you! This sets the chance for them to do so when stealing.

## Save Compatability
This mod uses the vanilla biocoding feature added in 1.1. The only thing this mod does is add more interaction with that. This mod is safe to add or remove from any save. However if you do remove it, the biocode will remain and there may be harmless errors.

## Mod Compatability
As long as the weapon can be equipped like in vanilla, it can biocoded.

Also this is my first mod of considerable size. Yay~. It became more complex than I thought it would be, but I learned a lot so I guess that's cool, like Harmony. Harmony is so cool. Also may I recommend the [Rename Everything](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2561691857) mod to help personalize your weapon names?
